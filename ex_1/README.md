# ActiveRecord Migration Drill - Patients and Doctors

This drill includes three complete models:
* `Patient`
* `Doctor`
* `DoctorPatientRelationship` (the join model)

These models include ActiveRecord relations and a few validations. Your
challenge is to get the tests passing by **writing the missing migrations.**

Create your migrations in `migrations.rb`, following the example.

Refer to the associations and tests to decide on your database schema. **Do not
make any changes to the models.**
